## Technologies

## Usage 

No need to sign up, just visit the homepage [here](https://lck-tracking.herokuapp.com), or the webapp [here](https://lck-tracking.herokuapp.com/app). You probably want to be familiar with the concept of the [expected value](https://lcs-tracking.herokuapp.com/expected_value.html) of a bet. The basic idea is to enable users to quickly and easily identify high value bets.
