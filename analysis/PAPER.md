## Abstract

I developed a very simple model to identify high value bets in the League of Legends Championship Series for the "first markets", which include "first blood", "first turret" etc. The model ranks the bets using expected value (EV) and discusses several other parameters to further optimize the ranked bets. The model's predicted EV and the actual results were accurate to within 5%.

## Introduction

I developed a very simple model to identify high value bets in the League of Legends Championship Series for the "first markets", which include "first blood", "first turret" etc. The model ranks bets by their Expected Value (EV) and the team's difference in chance of success for the market in question. By running some simple simulations, I settled on an ideal minimum EV and difference in chance of success.
